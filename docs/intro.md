# Introduction

<img src="/img/ben-frank.png"/>

The goal of this project is to create a more equitable and sustainable financial system that enables communities to build prosperity together. This is a deep dive into the **Stable Credit** protocol and how it enables the ancient alternative economic model of _mutual credit_ to scale in the modern world.

## Mutual Credit

A mutual credit network is a trading network where participants can extend credit to one another in exchange for network offerings. The network's currency is created when members extend credit to one another and is destroyed when debts are repaid. Traditionally, mutual credit network currency is not backed by any asset or collateral but by the mutual trust of the network's members.

## Stable Credit

The **Stable Credit** protocol extends the concept of mutual credit to include a shared [**Assurance Pool**](/) that backs the network currency. This enables networks to scale beyond the social trust of its members by empowering members to contribute to the network resiliency together. The **Stable Credit** protocol is designed to be a building block for a new generation of mutual credit networks that can scale to new heights, allowing larger groups to collaborate in mutuality.
